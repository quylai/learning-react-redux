CREATE REACT EXPRESS APP

--------------------------------
About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

--------------------------------
Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:
      npm install

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:
      npm start

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

--------------------------------
Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
